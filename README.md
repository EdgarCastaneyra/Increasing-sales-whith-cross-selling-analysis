# Increasing-sales-whith-cross-selling-analysis

This code was built in Visual Fox Pro and extracts sales information from an ERP to do a cross-selling analysis. 

It filters all sales that were made of the product to be analyzed, extract the quantity and amount sold from all the products that accompanied the sale of the main product. The correlation between the quantity and the amount sold of the main product is measured vs. the same variables of the rest of the products. It also analyses the percentage of appearances of the rest of the products in each sale of the main product.

This allows the company to do Kits of products that are always sold together and increases its sales by 5% per month. 

Another implemented strategy derived from this analysis was to create discounts on the most sold products that have a high correlation with little-sold products with a higher profit margin.
